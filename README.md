## Introduction

The goal of this project is to learn how works the redux and how to fetch data and set it into redux storage, also i have got more practice using react-router. One of the main challenges i faced was to understand the whole implementation of redux store, the rest of code wasnt so difficult.

## Features

This project has the following features:

- We can get random characther from marvel api each time when we click the button 
- We can load more and more (comics/characthers)
- We can click on each card and be navigated to its description page

## Technologies Used

This project is built using React, Redux, and Axios.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used for rendering the components and managing the application state.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It is used for managing the application state in a central store.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It is used for making API calls to the Marvel API and fetching data.

Other technologies used in the project include:

- **React Router DOM**: A library for routing in React applications. It is used for handling navigation between different views in the application.
- **Redux Thunk**: A middleware for Redux that allows handling asynchronous actions. It is used for dispatching async actions in Redux.
- **React Redux**: A library for connecting React components to the Redux store. It is used for accessing the store state and dispatching actions from React components.
